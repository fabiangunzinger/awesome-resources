# Awesome resources

A personal repository of stuff I find useful. This is not meant to be exhaustive, but rather a curated list of things I want to have easily accessible.

For resources on experimentation and causal inference, contribute to
[awesome-causal-inference](https://github.com/matteocourthoud/awesome-causal-inference).
