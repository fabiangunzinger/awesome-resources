## Foundations in maths and stats

- [Mathematical biostats bootcamp](https://www.coursera.org/learn/biostatistics) (highly recommended by Erin Shellman: 'Donâ€™t spend too much of your time watching the lectures.  Instead test yourself with the quizzes and assignments and watch the videos in areas where you are weak.')
